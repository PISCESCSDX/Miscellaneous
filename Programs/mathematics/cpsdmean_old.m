% Calculation of the cross-power- and cross-phase-spectral density. 
% The deviation of the phase is included as vector 'phstd'.
% If s1 is before s2 a positive phase shift is the result.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% IN: s1, s2: signals (same length)
%     fs: sample frequency (Hz)
%     n: amount of windows for windowing
%     olap: overlap between windows [0..1]
%     fend: end frequency (Hz)
%     k: histogram parameter (amount of bars in the phase histogram)
%OUT: Amean: averaged cpsd-amplitude
%     phmean: averaged phase (Pi)
%     fspli: frequency axis (Hz)
%     stdph: standard deviation from windowed FFT of the cross-phase
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%EX1: s1 ~ sin(2*pi*f1*t       ) (s1 is pi/2 before s2!)
%     s2 ~ sin(2*pi*f1*t - pi/2)
%     yields a cross-phase of +pi/2 at frequency f1!

% Calculation of the phase error
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The standard deviation of the phase is used as a measure of the error.
% But since the phase is periodic [-pi, pi] the error can't be calculated 
% as for linear paramters. - A problem arises when the phase is fluctuating
% close to pi or -pi. Then it jumps between pi and -pi.
% Solution: A histogram of the phases will be plottet, the maximum will be
% detected and the phase vector will be shifted by this value.

% length of phase spectrum (=length of frequency spectrum)
N = size(ph,1);
for i = 1:N
  % put all phases belonging to one frequency in one vector a
    a = ph(i,:);
  % 1: make an phase histogram for each frequency;
    [yh, xh] = hist(a, k);
  % 2: detect x-position xmax of the maximum of the histogram
    [~, imax] = max(yh);
    xmax = xh(imax);
  % 3: substract the xmax value from the phase vector
  %    (phases p > +1 will be changed to p-2,
  %     phases p < -1 will be changed to p+2)
    a = a - xmax;
      ic = find(a>1);  a(ic) = a(ic)-2;
      ic = find(a<-1); a(ic) = a(ic)+2;
% 4. from this phase vector the std will be calculated a a measure for the
%    standard deviation of the phase phase ;
    ph_par(i) = std(a);
