Rough summary about the "camera code"
=====================================
In simple words the code calculates the picture of a light emitting volume (e.g., a plasma) imaged by a single lens on a screen (e.g., a CCD chip). The code does not divide between wavelengths - here, light is just a measure for energy flux. (However, it would be possible to calculate a picture for several wavelength ranges and sum it up at the end to obtain a real color simulation.)


Basic steps for Getting results
-------------------------------
(1.) Provide the data of the light emitting plasma volume: mkplasdat.m
A 3D grid matrix is calculated, that contains the light emission from each spatial grid point.
Here, I modeled the plasma light of a drift wave with certain drift wave parameters (mode number, parallel length, and so on).

(2.) Calculate the image of the stationary (background) plasma:
camlenssimu0.m

(3.) Calculate the image of the background+fluctuation plasma:
camlenssimu1.m

(4.) Compact the results:
camsummary.m

(5.) Plot the results:
mkpicsingle.m

The other included m-files are just sub-routine files.
The test picture will look not good, because in the mkplasdat.m
the grid resolution is small, to save calculation time.
Better results (=longer calcualtion) can be achieved with
xres = 0.5; % mm
yres = 0.5; % mm
zres = 50;  % mm
